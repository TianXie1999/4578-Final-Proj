Causal Effect of Population with Masks on Early Covid19 Expansion

Report: https://github.com/TianXie1999/4578-Final-Proj/blob/main/4578_proj.pdf

Motivated by one recent paper and Covid19 datasets posted by its authors[1], we decide to analyze the causal inference on whether wearing masks can influence the spread of Covid19 in United States. With the comprehensive data-set[2][3] and necessary preprocessing, we have constructed appropriate DAG and use different techniques to estimate the ATE including \textbf{IP Weighting, Standardization G-estimation}. Moreover, we also find an instrument variable \textbf{Party} to estimate ATE. With different techniques, we compare the results and discover they give similar but slightly different estimations.
